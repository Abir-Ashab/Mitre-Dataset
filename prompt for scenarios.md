I would like to simulate a set of attack scenarios inspired by the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. Below is my defined attack chain, including several options for each stage. Your task is to generate **all possible permutations and combinations of attack scenarios**, ensuring that **at least one technique is selected from each step (1 to 5, 7, and 8)**. The **lateral movement (step 6) is optional**â€”include scenarios both with and without it.

Please use natural combinations where steps flow logically from one to another. This simulation will help visualize and plan for varied attacker behaviors.

**Attack Steps and Variants:**

1. **Initial Access Variants:**

   * Convincing phishing email/telegram/whatsapp message with a website link
   * Convincing phishing email/telegram/whatsapp message with just an `.exe` file
   * Convincing phishing email/telegram/whatsapp message with fake installer (e.g., spoofed update of a favorite game)
   * Convincing phishing email/telegram/whatsapp message Payload bound with image/pdf/doc
   * Other creative initial access vectors (you can add by yourself, but add at the last scenarios)

2. **Credential Harvesting** (Through RAT and WebBrowserPassView)

3. **Attacker Control Timing:**

   * Immediate control after compromise (Using RAT)
   * Delayed control after a period of dormancy (Tell methods)

4. **Persistence Techniques:**

   * Bootloader-based payload persistence
   * Using Task Scheduler to persist payload

5. **Data Exfiltration Channels:**

   * USB
   * Drive
   * RAT server
   * OneDrive
   * Mega
   * FTP
   * GitHub

6. **Lateral Movement (Optional):**

   * Windows SMB
   * Internal spear phishing

7. **Final Payload Action:**

   * System wipeout
   * Data theft
   * Ransomware deployment

8. **Post-Attack Cleanup:**

   * Leaving no trace
   * Leaving identifiable traces

**Requirements:**

* Output all unique scenario combinations.
* Ensure each scenario includes **at least one** option from steps 1 to 5, 7, and 8.
* Step 6 (Lateral movement) is optional.
* Present results clearly, optionally in table or bullet point format.
